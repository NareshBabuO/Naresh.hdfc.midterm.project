Introduction:
Introduce the Office Leave Management Application project and provide a brief overview of the objectives of the system.

System Architecture:
a. Front-end: The front-end of the application will be developed using Thymeleaf, a popular template engine for Spring Boot.
b. Back-end: The back-end of the application will be developed using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications.
c. Database: The application will use a MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store employee and leave-related data.

Employee Self-Service Portal:
a. The employee self-service portal will be the main interface for employees to apply for leaves, view their leave balances, and track the status of their applications.
b. The portal will be accessible via a login page, and each employee will have their own secure account with access to their leave information.
c. Employees will be able to submit leave applications with details such as leave type, start and end dates, reason, and any supporting documentation.

Manager Approval Workflow:
a. Managers will have their own secure login to access the application, where they can view pending leave requests and approve or reject them.
b. The application will automate email notifications to the manager when a new leave request is submitted, and reminders if the request has not been processed in a timely manner.
c. Managers will be able to view an employee's leave history and current leave balances before approving or rejecting a request.

Leave Types and Policies:
a. The application will support different types of leaves such as annual leave, sick leave, and maternity leave, with different policies and entitlements for each.
b. The application will enforce company leave policies such as minimum notice period and maximum number of consecutive leave days.
c. The application will update employee leave balances automatically when a leave request is approved or rejected.

Reports and Analytics:
a. The application will generate reports and analytics on leave requests, leave balances, and other leave-related data.
b. Reports can be viewed by managers or HR administrators to track employee leave patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
c. Reports can be exported to different file formats such as PDF or CSV for further analysis or sharing.

Conclusion:
Summarize the benefits of the Office Leave Management Application for the organization, including improved efficiency, reduced administrative overhead, and a better employee experience.
